#Attempting to add branches to my github

## Branches allow for modification of code without overwritten the main code

so if you haven't created a new branch you can type git checkout -b nameOfBranch if 
you have already created a branch e.g Andrew has a sick 
branch and want to change branch type in git checkout Andrew has a sick branch 
when making changes and merging code between branches 

git commit name of branch you wanna merge to  
merging new branch -> master branch git checkout master then git merge Andrew 
has a sick branch

make sure you're in that branch with git checkout name of branch 
then execute git push branch name
